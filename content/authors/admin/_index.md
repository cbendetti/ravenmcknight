I'm a senior at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) studying statistics with minors in geography and creative writing. Right now, I'm excited about spatial data in public transit and public health, as well as creating reproducible research and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) resources! This year, I participated in the [National Gallery of Art's](https://www.nga.gov/) first annual Innovation Lab on the only undergraduate team. We explored gender diversity in the Gallery's collection and [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewm4cL3vn6k&) to Gallery curators and staff!

Right now, I'm working at [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/home) as a Research and Analytics data science intern. This position inspired my senior thesis fitting hierarchical spatial Bayesian models to Twin Cities bus ridership. I love using these types of models to answer "real world" questions while I learn about spatial statistics methodology! When I'm <i>not &nbsp;</i>thinking about statistics, I love rock climbing, poetry, and working on my design and visualization skills.
