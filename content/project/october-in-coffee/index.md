I was recently inspired by [Allysa Fowers](https://twitter.com/alyssafowers/status/1178335347538825217) visualization of her fall semester coffee consumption. I tracked my own coffee-drinking data for a month and created this plot.

It was fun to see where I drank abnormal amounts of coffee, or coffee at abnormal times -- like the office hours I hold on Mondays at 7pm or during my trip to DC towards the end of the month.
